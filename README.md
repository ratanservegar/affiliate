Affiliate is a platform agnostic link affiliator. Simplify affiliating links with automatic affiliation in the browser. Affiliate works with libraries that mutate the DOM after the page loads, including React.

## Installation

```

## What It Can Do

Affiliate can modify the following link into any of the others.
```html
<a href="https://example.com/shop/product/item-id">Original</a>
```

```html
<a href="https://example.com/shop/product/item-id?ref=my-tag">New Query Tags</a>
<a href="https://example.com/shop/product/item-id/ref/my-tag">Modified URL Path</a>
<a href="https://my-tag.example.com/shop/product/item-id">Modified Host Name</a>
```

Affiliate has easy [plugins](https://affiliate.js.org/plugins), including one for [Amazon](https://affiliate.js.org/plugins/amazon), which simplify adding affiliate links even more.

Read [the documentation](https://affiliate.js.org/) for more advanced usage.

```js
const Affiliate = require('affiliate');
const aff = Affiliate({
    tags: [
        {
            hosts: ['example.com', 'www.example.com'],
            query: {
                ref: 'my-tag' // This means ?ref=my-tag
            }
        },
        {
            hosts: ['example.org', 'shop.example.org'],
            query: {
                tag: 'my-tag2' // This means ?tag=my-tag2
            }
        }
    ]
});
aff.attach();
```

### Blogs and Related Sites

A simplified codeless solution might better suit some blogging-style sites.

Insert this code into the page `<head>`. The contents of the `data-aff` attribute will tell Affiliate what to do.
```html
<!-- Replace 2.0 with your intended version -->
<script data-aff="amazon.com, www.amazon.com : tag = MY-AMAZON-TAG" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/affiliate@2.0/dist/affiliate.js" async id="aff-js"></script>
```

#### data-aff Syntax
The syntax for data-aff is a comma separated list of domains, a colon, and then comma separated list of url queries in the format `key=value`. Multiple website groups can be separated by an exclamation mark.
```
amazon.com, www.amazon.com : tag = MY-AMAZON-TAG ! example.com, shop.example.com : ref = MY-OTHER-TAG
```

## Testing

Affiliate is tested using Jasmine. The test for the minified package is available [here](https://affiliate.js.org/test/index.html) and an example webpack package [here](https://affiliate.js.org/test/webpack.html).
